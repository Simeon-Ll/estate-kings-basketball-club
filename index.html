            Estate Kings, a local grassroots basketball club,
              was founded in [year] by a group of passionate basketball enthusiasts in Abesan estate locality.
              With just a handful of eager kids and a single outdoor court,
              they aimed to provide a safe and nurturing environment for young
              athletes to develop their skills and foster a love for the game.
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the years, Estate Kings grew steadily, attracting more
            children and dedicated coaches who volunteered their time. 
            In 2021, African Giants made a mark in their lives providing them with modernized utilities
            , marking a significant milestone in its history. This allowed them to offer 
            year-round training and expand their programs, including youth leagues and skill development camps.
